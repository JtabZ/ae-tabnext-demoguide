# 📊 Analytics Demo Reality Guide

**A Practical Guide for AEs: Tableau Next, AI Expectations, and Demo Timelines**

> **The One-Liner:** "AI raised the bar for what 'good' looks like in analytics demos, but it didn't lower the bar for how long it takes us to build them—let's scope accordingly."

## ⚡ The Current Landscape

AI has changed the output, but not the input.

| **✅ What AI Changed** | **❌ What Didn't Change** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Faster Insights:** Analysis in seconds. | **Data Prep:** Still need to connect sources. |
| **Natural Language:** Conversational Q&A. | **Data Modeling:** Defining relationships & metrics. |
| **Automated Discovery:** Finding patterns. | **Demo Org Setup:** Creating clean, realistic data. |
| **High Expectations:** "ChatGPT-like" experience. | **QA:** Testing to ensure it works live. |

### 🔮 Tableau Next Status
* **What it is:** AI-powered data prep, conversational interface, and automated insights.
* **Current Reality:** **Not Generally Available.** We cannot rely on it for customer demos yet. Traditional build methods are still required.

## 📐 The Expectation Gap

* **Customer Expectation:** "Show me an AI agent that answers *any* question about my business instantly."
* **The Reality:** We must connect data → build models → define metrics → configure AI → train → test.

### ⏳ Realistic Timelines for Common Requests
* **Simple Dashboard:** ~1 Week (if data exists)
* **Customer 360 + AI Insights:** 2–3 Weeks
* **Predictive Analytics:** 3–4 Weeks
* **Full Platform + AI Agents:** 6–8 Weeks

## 🏆 Demo Tier Framework

Choose the right tier based on your deal stage and timeline.

### Tier 1: Quick Hit (1–2 Weeks)
* **Best For:** Discovery calls, early-stage deals.
* **What You Get:** Pre-built data, standard dashboards, 1–2 AI features.
* **Trade-off:** Generic use case, not industry-specific.

### Tier 2: Business Case (2–4 Weeks) ⭐️ *Recommended*
* **Best For:** Competitive situations, mid-stage evaluation.
* **What You Get:** Industry-specific data, custom dashboards, 3–5 AI features.
* **Trade-off:** Requires lead time and SE resources.

### Tier 3: Platform Vision (4–8 Weeks)
* **Best For:** Strategic Enterprise deals, C-level presentations.
* **What You Get:** Multi-cloud, end-to-end journey, full AI agent showcase.
* **Trade-off:** Massive time investment and maintenance.

> **Pro Tip:** Most deals don't need Tier 3. Tier 2 often wins just as effectively with half the investment.

## 🤝 How to Partner Effectively

### ✅ Demo Request Checklist
Before asking for a demo, be ready to answer:
1.  **Deal Stage:** (Discovery / Evaluation / Decision)
2.  **Timeline:** When is the actual demo date?
3.  **Audience:** Who will be in the room?
4.  **Must-Haves:** Top 3 capabilities to show.
5.  **Competitor Context:** What are they showing?

### 💬 Conversation Starters
* **Short Timeline:** "Given we have [X days], what is the strongest Tier 1 demo we can deliver?"
* **Complex Ask:** "The customer wants [Complex Feature]. Can we show a scaled version now and roadmap the rest?"
* **Planning Ahead:** "I have a demo in [X weeks]. Let's align on scope early."

### 🌟 Best Practices
* **DO:** Give lead time, share context early, and trust SE expertise on scope.
* **DON'T:** Make last-minute requests, allow scope creep, or promise features we can't deliver.
