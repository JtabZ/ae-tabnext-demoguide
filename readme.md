## 📖 About This Guide

The **Analytics Demo Reality Guide** is a strategic resource designed for Account Executives (AEs) and Sales Engineers (SEs) working in the analytics and business intelligence space. 

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) raises customer expectations for "instant insights," this webpage serves as a reality check and planning tool. It explains the technical constraints of building modern demos and provides a framework for scoping them correctly.

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

The primary goal of this page is to **bridge the gap between customer expectations and technical reality.**

* **Manage Expectations:** It clarifies that while AI makes *consuming* insights faster, it does not necessarily make *building* the underlying data models faster.
* **Align Sales Teams:** It creates a shared language for AEs and SEs to discuss timelines (e.g., why a "simple AI demo" might take 3 weeks).
* **Prevent Burnout:** By offering a tiered system for demos, it helps teams avoid over-committing resources to early-stage deals.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

* **Account Executives (AEs):** To understand what is realistic to promise customers and how to request demos effectively.
* **Sales Engineers (SEs):** To use as a reference point when negotiating scope and timelines with their sales counterparts.
* **Sales Leadership:** To understand the resource investment required for different types of customer presentations.

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered

### 1. The "AI Expectation Gap"
The guide details the specific areas where AI has improved the workflow (natural language queries, automated discovery) versus areas where it hasn't (data prep, modeling, QA).

### 2. The Demo Tier Framework
A standardized approach to scoping demos based on deal stage:
* **Tier 1 (Quick Hit):** Generic data, 1-2 weeks. Best for discovery.
* **Tier 2 (Business Case):** Industry-specific, 2-4 weeks. Best for mid-stage deals.
* **Tier 3 (Platform Vision):** Full custom build, 4-8 weeks. Reserved for strategic accounts.

### 3. Partnership Best Practices
Actionable advice on how AEs and SEs can collaborate, including a "Demo Scoping Decision Tree" and a checklist for submitting demo requests.
